Simple ColorPicker App
App uses Kotlin and Compose.

Using Compose
Please build a simple color picker in 30 minutes:

Create a single-screen Android app with three sliders (SeekBars) for RGB values./n
Each slider should range from 0-255, representing the R, G, and B color values
Include labels for each slider indicating the current numeric value (0-255)
Display a preview rectangle/square that shows the currently selected color
Show the corresponding hex code (e.g., #FF5733) of the selected color
The hex code should update in real-time as the sliders are adjusted
The preview area should update in real-time as sliders are adjusted
Include a “Copy” button that copies the hex code to the clipboard
The app must handle device rotation without losing the current color
Use proper layouts to ensure the UI is responsive on different screen sizes
No third-party libraries allowed - use only standard Android components
